# CS:GO Images
A simple script to get an image from all the maps in the CS:GO map pool and then save it.  
This was used to generate the images set in the Rich Presence application of [CS:GO Discord RP](https://github.com/Retr0-01/CSGO-Discord-RP) in the Discord Developers panel.

> **NOTICE:** This script no longer works since the repository from which the images were pulled has changed structure and no longer contains them.
